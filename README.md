## Optimal Constrained Task Planning as Mixed Integer Programming
A mixed integer programming solver for optimal planning in symbolic planning problems with discrete-valued and/or continuous-valued constraints.

### Examples
Pure PDDL planning examples and block stacking example scripts can be found in the   `examples/` folder. There are 10 block stacking PDDL problems with increasing difficulty in the `pddl_graph/pddl/blocksworld/` folder. Any of these can be run with the example scripts.
