A solver for optimal planning in symbolic planning problems with discrete-valued and/or continuous-valued constraints.

## Installation

Press `]` at the Julia REPL to enter the package manager and run:
```
add https://github.com/alphonsusadubredu/mip.git
```

## Examples
Pure PDDL planning examples and block stacking example scripts can be found in the   [`examples`](examples) folder. There are 10 block stacking PDDL problems with increasing difficulty in the [`blocksworld`](pddl_graph/pddl/blocksworld/) folder. Any of these can be run with the example scripts.
